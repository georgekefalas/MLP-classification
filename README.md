#Multilayer Perceptron for SDT Classification 
This repository contains a Java implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for solving a supervised discrete classification problem (SDT).

The implementation supports multi-class classification using a fully connected neural network with three hidden layers and configurable activation functions. The model is trained using mini-batch gradient descent and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

The project uses separate training and testing datasets (`train.txt` and `test.txt`) in TXT format and includes functionality for training, evaluation and prediction. A **Report** is also included, with the **first page showing the categories used** in the SDT problem.
